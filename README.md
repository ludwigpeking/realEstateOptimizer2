### A Decision-Making Acceleration Utility for Real Estate Developers

The real estate developers often face these difficult decisions:

1. Balancing higher product prices with customer affordability: Developers want to sell their products at higher prices to maximize profits. However, this can reduce affordability for budget-sensitive customers, leading to slower revenues and a delay in recouping their investment. With loans and debts to pay off, the pressure to sell products at a loss can be overwhelming. How can developers strike the right balance?
2. Diversifying products versus management costs: Developers understand that diversifying products can attract a broader range of customers. However, this also increases management costs and presents challenges for innovation. Quantifying the value that diversification can create is a critical concern for developers. How can they make accurate estimations?
